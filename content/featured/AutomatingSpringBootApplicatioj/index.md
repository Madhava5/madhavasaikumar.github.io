Automated the CI/CD pipeline for a Spring Boot application using Jenkins and Argo CD. Designed a Jenkins pipeline for streamlined development, testing, and deployment, integrating SonarQube for static code analysis. Built and pushed Docker images to Docker Hub, and automated Kubernetes deployment updates on Amazon EKS. Leveraged Argo CD for continuous deployment and AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging. Applied Kubernetes security best practices and configured AWS IAM roles for secure access.
