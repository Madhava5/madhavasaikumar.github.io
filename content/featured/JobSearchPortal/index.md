Developed and deployed a comprehensive job search portal using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
Node.js), incorporating advanced search capabilities with Elasticsearch. Ensured seamless user interaction through
features like user authentication, real-time job matching, and detailed job listings. Containerized the application with
Docker and managed deployments with Kubernetes for scalability. Automated CI/CD processes with Jenkins for efficient
and reliable updates. The responsive interface and powerful search functionality led to high user engagement and
satisfaction.
